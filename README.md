# Live Coding
Messing around with Extempore. Developing an xtlang interface for my desired performance set-up.

### Projects

#### xtlang MIDI Interface
Seamless control of my Novation Launchkey's advanced functions. Hopefully can be generalized over time into a customizable control surface driver.

#### Useful blocks of Extempore code
* Synth designs
* beat-synced looper for performance data (MIDI/audio)
* personal instrument library

#### Extempore sampler rewrite
* support for multi-layered samples
* ideally able to handle a realistic sampled piano
